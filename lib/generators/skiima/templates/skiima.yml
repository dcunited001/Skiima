#classes:
#  friend:
#  team_member: team_member.rb
#
#   you'll need to describe the classes
#     that you want skiima to manage here
#
#   if you want the default behavior of skiima
#     add the class name in lower case (n.b. friend)
#
#   if for some reason, you want to override
#     the behavior of Skiima::LoaderBase for
#     a particular class, specify the file name
#     which needs to be the same as the class name
#     (n.b. team_member)  doing so allows you
#     to write what ever behavior you want
#     for the Skiima::LoaderBase create and drop methods
#
#   also, please note that skiima.yml is used
#     to generate depends.yml, where you can
#     specify the load order
#
#   don't worry, you can run `rails g skiima:depends`
#     more than once without overwriting your files
#

options:
  load_order: sequential  # future options may include 'intelligent'
